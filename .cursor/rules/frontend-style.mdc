- Use React with TypeScript and functional components only.
- Prefer named exports; avoid default exports.
- Enforce strict types. Avoid `any`.
- UI styling: Tailwind CSS utilities; keep components small and focused.
- Animations: use Framer Motion for subtle page and element transitions.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, proper labels/ARIA, focus styles.
- Theming: Tailwind dark mode via `class` on `<html>`. Default theme is light.
- Routing: React Router. Pages live under `src/pages`. Layouts under `src/layouts`.
- Components live under `src/components`; keep them presentational and reusable.
- Hooks live under `src/hooks`; avoid business logic in components.
- Keep solutions simple; prefer composition over abstractions.
- Avoid inline comments. If comments are required, explain why, not how.
- Formatting: max line length 100, trailing commas, semicolons, double quotes.
- Aliases: use `@/` for `src/` imports.
- Do not commit build outputs, caches, or secrets. Follow `.gitignore`.
